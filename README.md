**HiCnv** works on contact counts at the single restriction enzyme (RE) fragment level in order to leverage Hi-C data at its highest possible and native resolution. Briefly, HiCnv first computes 1D read coverage for each RE fragment, followed by normalization for GC content, mappability and fragment length, and by smoothing using kernel density estimation (KDE). KDE smoothed counts are divided into potential CNV segments using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and these segments are further processed for refinement of their breakpoint coordinates (segment ends) and assignment of their CNV labels. See our [paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/2/338/4557186) for more details.

The current version of this HiCnv uses [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to facilitate deployment and improve reproducibility. Currently, HiCnv is setup to download SRA files followed by alignment with HiCPro and CNV analysis. PLEASE READ: Snakemake uses a system of templating which I will be using in this documentation, templating refers to the use of `{variable_name}` to generalize a file path and common templates I will use include:
- `{re}` - restriction enzyme
- `{srr}` - SRR ID
- `{cline}` - cell line

## Software dependencies
Rules within this workflow attempt to facilitate the installation of a few key software but there may still be some user-specific installation steps. The following is a list of required software and packages where applicable:
- Python 2.7 
- Python 3.7
  - snakemake 
  - ...
- R 
  - ...
- HiCPro Docker img
- HiCPro Utilities
- Singularity 

## Usage
### Process the hg38 reference files
To download the hg38 reference use (Rule download_hg38_files): 
<pre>
snakemake --profile workflow/profiles/pbs-torque results/refs/hg38/hg38.fa.gz
</pre>

Then index those reference files using (Rule bowtie2_index_ref_genome):
<pre>
snakemake --profile workflow/profiles/pbs-torque results/refs/hg38/hg38.1.bt2
</pre>


Lastly, digest the reference genome in with Mbo1 and HindIII, these will be used
later in the HiCPro configuration process (Rule digest_reference_genome): 
<pre>
snakemake --profile workflow/profiles/pbs-torque results/refs/restriction_enzymes/hg38_mboi_digestion.bed
snakemake --profile workflow/profiles/pbs-torque results/refs/restriction_enzymes/hg38_hindiii_digestion.bed
</pre>

### Prepare the HiCPro config
The HiCPro configuration file must be setup manually as specified by [HiCPro](https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro/blob/master/doc/MANUAL.md)
and includes setting `GENOME_FRAGMENT = results/refs/restriction_enzymes/hg38_{re}_digestion.bed`. Once completed store the configuration file within `/results/refs/hicpro/config-hicpro.{re}.txt`.

### Download SRA paired fastq data
Uses Rule download_paired_fastq_sra:
<pre>
snakemake --profile workflow/profiles/pbs-torque results/main/{cline}/sra/{srr}_1.fastq.gz
</pre>

### Alignment
Process your Hi-C fastq files with [HiCPro pipeline](https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro) (Rule hicpro_align_only):
<pre>
snakemake --profile workflow/profiles/pbs-torque results/main/{cline}/hicpro/bowtie_results/bwt2/{srr}/{srr}_1_hg38.bwt2merged.bam
</pre>

### Generate the coverage, GC content, mappability and fragment length information file
Download the mappability file which is used to generate the F_GC_MAP file (Rule download_hg38_mappability):
<pre>
snakemake --profile workflow/profiles/pbs-torque results/refs/hg38_mappability/k50.Umap.MultiTrackMappability.sorted.bedGraph
</pre>

Rule process_refeature: generate a restriction fragment specific file known as the
*.fragments.F_GC_MAP.bed (Fragment length, GC content and Mappability information file
file using existings commands.
<pre>
snakemake --profile workflow/profiles/pbs-torque results/refs/restriction_enzymes/hg38_{re}_digestion.extended.fragment.gc.map.sorted.bed
</pre>

One dimensionalize your HiC data using pre-existing "scripts Read_coverage_generation/run_1DReadCoverage.pl" and create the *.perREfragStats file (Rule oned_read_coverage):
<pre>
snakemake --profile workflow/profiles/pbs-torque results/main/{cline}/hicnv/{srr}.perREfragStats
</pre>

### Run the CNV analysis
Finally run the CNV analyis which uses scripts/hicnv_v2.R (Rule run_hicnv):
<pre>
snakemake --profile workflow/profiles/pbs-torque results/main/{cline}/hicnv/{cline}_{srr}_hicnv_final.test
</pre>

## Workflow schema
The following dag diagram was generated by snakemake and shows the connections between snakemake rules which for the basis for the HiCnv workflow.
